# Human Activity Recognition

This project focuses on classifying human activities using sensor data. It employs machine learning techniques to predict various actions based on sensor readings, and it provides a web interface for users to upload and analyze data.

## Features

- Classify and predict human activities using sensor data.
- Machine learning model built with PyTorch for robust predictions.
- User-friendly web interface powered by Django for easy data upload and visualization.

## Frameworks Used

- PyTorch: Building and training the machine learning model.
- Django: Creating a user-friendly web interface for data analysis.
- Python: A programming language for implementing the project.
- Git: Version control for collaborative development.
